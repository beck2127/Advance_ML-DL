This study presents an innovative approach to the problem of fall detection, 
leveraging wearable sensor technology. Initially, we delineate the definition 
of falls, followed by an examination of their classification methods and categories. 
To address this issue, we propose a typology that employs 
both Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network (CNN1D + LSTM)
